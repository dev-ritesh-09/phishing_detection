# Phishing Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using machine learning techniques. By applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification models, the system identifies malicious websites with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**: Cleans, transforms, and prepares the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilizes data visualization techniques to uncover key patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements and evaluates multiple classification algorithms to enhance detection accuracy.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model assessment.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dev-ritesh-09/phishing-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd phishing-detection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset in `main.ipynb`.
2. Execute the notebook step by step to preprocess data, train models, and analyze results.
3. Evaluate model performance and refine as needed.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset (`phishing.csv`) contains various features designed to differentiate phishing websites from legitimate ones. The data undergoes thorough preprocessing to enhance model performance.
